I am a Computer Science Engineering student. During my studies, I have had the opportunity to work in and study many fields,
such as application development, quality assurance, and database management. I have worked with numerous technologies
throughout my career, including various languages, frameworks, and databases. I am excited to put into use all the knowledge
and skills I have acquired over the years, and I am open to exploring the different fields and challenges that the real world has
to offer.
